It would be good to include a windows version, but I haven't used Windows since the days of XP.\r\n\r\nIt's quite possible this will start out as a set of bash scripts and migrate to a compiled (C/C++) binary or possibly Python. I have a preference for a binary, however that's a much bigger learning curve for me. Let's see how we go. \r\n\r\n##proposed features\r\n\r\n    hashutils <dir1> <dir2>     \r\n      compare files in <dir1> to files in <dir2>\r\n        compare only files in <dir1> and do they exist in <dir2>\r\n        compare directories and create report\r\n          files in both directories\r\n          files in dir1 only\r\n          files in dir2 only\r\n          files conflicting between directories\r\n            these are filenames that exist in both directories but are not identical\r\n      \r\n    hashutils <path/to/file1> <path/to/file2>\r\n      compare two files (not necessarily in the same directory)\r\n      \r\n    hashutils <path/to/file> <dir>\r\n      does <file> appear in <dir>\r\n        initial search by filename\r\n          file exists and is the same (name,size,hash)\r\n          file exists and is <new name>\r\n          file does not exist\r\n          \r\n",
