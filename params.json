It would be good to include a windows version, but I haven't used Windows since the days of XP.\r\n\r\nIt's quite possible this will start out as a set of bash scripts and migrate to a compiled (C/C++) binary or possibly Python. I have a preference for a binary, however that's a much bigger learning curve for me. Let's see how we go. \r\n",
